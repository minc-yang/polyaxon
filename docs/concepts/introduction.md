Welcome to Polyaxon, a platform for managing the whole lifecycle of large scale deep learning and machine learning applications.

Polyaxon deploys into any data center, cloud provider,
or can be hosted and managed by Polyaxon,
and it supports all the major deep learning frameworks such as Tensorflow, MXNet, Caffe, Torch, etc.

Polyaxon makes it faster, easier, and more efficient to develop machine learning and deep learning applications. 
It is designed for individuals, teams and organizations who need reproducibility, compliance, power, flexibility and performance. 
It allows workloads scheduling with smart container and node management, and turns GPU servers into shared, self-service resources for your team or organization.

Here  you will find a comprehensive guide for setting up Polyaxon on your cluster,
and information for training, tracking, monitoring, and managing your data science lifecycle.

We do our best to make this documentation clear and user friendly,
if you see anything that is incorrect or have any questions,
feel free to reach out at the
[issues page](https://github.com/polyaxon/polyaxon/issues),
[forum](https://join.slack.com/t/polyaxon/shared_invite/enQtMzQ0ODc2MDg1ODc0LWY2ZTdkMTNmZjBlZmRmNjQxYmYwMTBiMDZiMWJhODI2ZTk0MDU4Mjg5YzA5M2NhYzc5ZjhiMjczMDllYmQ2MDg)
or [contact us](mailto:contact@polyaxon.com).

Please check our [quick start guide](/concepts/quick-start) to start training your first experiment.

To gain a deeper understanding of how polyaxon can help you iterate faster with your experiments, 
please take some time to familiarize yourself with the [architecture & experimentation workflow](/concepts/architecture/)

## Mission

Polyaxon’s mission is to make machine learning and deep learning simple and accessible to enterprises.

Current advances in machine learning and deep learning have direct impact on business, 
yet few companies are leveraging these latest technologies. 
The data science space is still lacking good tooling and best practices 
for organizing practitioners' workflows. It's particularly challenging 
because of the variety of tools and requirements used to develop production-ready models.

Our goal is to enable Polyaxon's users to use rigorous practices and workflows to 
go from reproducible and portable experiments to scalable model deployments.
