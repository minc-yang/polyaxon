We believe that the future of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) will be based on a rich ecosystem of open source tools.

By definition, the term "open source" refers to something people can modify and share because its design is publicly accessible. 
In other words, software for which the original source code is made freely available and may be redistributed and modified.
 
That being said, we have a fully managed version for teams who don't want to manage their own cluster, and an enterprise offering 
for companies who need features that only make sense for large teams.
