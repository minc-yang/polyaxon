## Create a new incoming webhook in Slack

First, you'll need to set up a new incoming webhook in your team's Slack configuration. An incoming webhook is a method for Slack to receive incoming messages to be posted to your Slack team from external services.

## Customise webhook & copy URL

Once the webhook is created, you can optionally customise the channel, name, and icon which the webhook uses whenever it posts a new message. Either way, however, you'll need to copy the Webhook URL at the very top.

## Add your Slack webhook to Polyaxon deployment config

Now you can add your slack webhook to the integrations' section:

```yaml
integrations:
  slack:
    - url: https://hooks.slack.com/services/T6QR3FYN7/BC34VRP/7KRWJAtQWOxjxYgee
    - url: https://hooks.slack.com/services/FGDR3FD34/BC34VRP/7KRWDSFSD3xjxYgee
      channel: channel12
```

## More automation with Zapier

You can also go further and connect other popular Polyaxon integrations to your Slack team using Zapier.
