## Visit Hipchat to create webhook integration

First, you'll need to set up a new incoming webhook in your team's [Hipchat](https://www.hipchat.com/docs/apiv2/method/create_webhook?_ga=2.203509264.1443225380.1545584678-263232814.1545584678) configuration. 
An incoming webhook is a method for Hipchat to receive incoming messages to be posted to your Hipchat team from external services.

## Add your Hipchat webhook to Polyaxon deployment config

Now you can add your hipchat's webhook to the integrations' section:

```yaml
integrations:
  hipchat:
    - url: https://hipchat.com/v2/room/room_id_or_name/webhook
```

## More automation with Zapier
