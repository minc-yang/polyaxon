## Visit Discord to create webhook integration

First, you'll need to set up a new incoming webhook in your team's [Discord](https://discordapp.com/developers/docs/resources/webhook) configuration. 
An incoming webhook is a method for Discord to receive incoming messages to be posted to your Discord team from external services.

## Add your Discord webhook to Polyaxon deployment config

Now you can add your Discord's webhook to the integrations' section:

```yaml
integrations:
  discord:
    - url: url1
    - url: url2
```

## More automation with Zapier

You can also go further and connect other popular Polyaxon integrations to discord using Zapier.
