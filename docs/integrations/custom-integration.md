## Scheduling

Polyaxon is in the process to abstract it's scheduling behaviour to allow different ways of scheduling workload, 
as a user you can create your own scheduler for Polyaxon. 

## API+webhook integrations

Polyaxon also supports custom API integrations which can be authenticated with individual keys, and deliver outgoing webhooks based on particular events.

## Zapier integrations

Finally, custom integrations can be easily created using Zapier to build simple or complex integrations, depending on your needs.
